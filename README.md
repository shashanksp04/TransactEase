                                                   ATM MACHINE REPLICA


Project Description :

This project is a replica of an Any Time Money (ATM) machine of a bank. The project operates like a normal machine and has the ability to create an account,deposit money,
withdraw money,check balance & history and change the pin. I've used Java and SQL in postGres to build this project. One of the main challenges while writing the code 
for this project was coming up with the ways to make the machine more user friendly. I've added a feature where the machine asks the user about whether he needs to 
do something else or not after every transaction. Anothr feature which I've added is that if the User enters the wrong information for more than 3 times the machine 
automatically declines the transaction and incase it was the wrong pin then it'll assist the user in changing the pin if he wants to.
